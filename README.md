## About Us

We are a group of 4th year students currently studying at UPEI. Under the guidance of Prof. David LeBlanc we have been trusted with creating an extension to the commonly used H5P framework which allows non-technical users to register with our application and start creating (and saving) various interactive components. Components such as: multiple choice questions, charts, and even crosswords! You can then integrate these components into any CMS you want (typically moodle or wordpress sites).

**Creating a component:**
